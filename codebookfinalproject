Event_date: this is just what day the tracker was used
 
Event_description: tells us if the information is from a game day or training session(detailed name for training session and time)

Player_name: the player using the tracker 
 
Event_type: game or not 

Event_location: similar to event_description tells you if the game was away or home (if it was a training it is home)

Event_result: if it was a game this will show win, tie, or draw(otherwise it says no result)


Total_distance_m: total distance ran in meters during the time the tracker was on 

   walk_distance_m(0 – 0.8 m/s), jog_distance_m(0.8 – 1.9 m/s), run_distance_m(1.9 – 4.2 m/s), and sprint_distance_m(6.7 – 8.1 m/s) distances all sum up to total_distance_m in meters and each has a specfic spead in m/s that goes with them 

Sprint_efforts: how many times an athlete breaks velocity of 6 m/s for longer than a second (making sure they are actually sprinting in training)

Intensity: a number that encapsulates  distance, speed and duration of an athletes high velocity efforts, the faster the speed the higher this number 

Zones(speeds for each zone):
zone_1_distance_m: Zone 1 = 0 – 0.8 m/s
zone_2_distance_m:Zone 2 = 0.8 – 1.9 m/s
zone_3_distance_m:Zone 3 = 1.9 – 3.0 m/s
zone_4_distance_m:Zone 4 = 3.0 – 4.2 m/s
zone_5_distance_m:Zone 5 = 4.2 – 5.3 m/s
zone_6_distance_m:Zone 6 = 5.3 – 6.7 m/s
zone_7_distance_m:Zone 7 = 6.7 – 8.1 m/s
zone_8_distance_m: Zone 8 = 8.1 – 11.0+ m/s

Hard_running_efforts: breaking 5.4 m/s for longer than a second

Hard_running_m: total distance that was over 5.4 m/s 
 
 
Work_rate_m: total distance meters/yards covered relative to time 
 
Top_speed_m: the fastest speed the player hit during the tracker time 

Total_Impact: this is the sum of impact light, impact medium, and impact heavy and it is a numerical value that means " a change in acceleration of at least 5.5g in less than 0.1s" , it is good to note that high values in this column means a player is out of their comfort zone and they may be sore the next day

performance_duration_min: how many minutes an athlete played during the specific event specified in the dataset
