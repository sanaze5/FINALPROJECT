Total_distance_m:* total distance ran in meters during the time the tracker was on 

Jog, run, sprint, and walk distance all sum up to this value in meters 

Sprint efforts: how many times an athlete breaks velocity of 6 m/s for longer than a second (making sure they are actually sprinting in training)



Zones:
Zone 1 = 0 – 0.8 m/s
Zone 2 = 0.8 – 1.9 m/s
Zone 3 = 1.9 – 3.0 m/s
Zone 4 = 3.0 – 4.2 m/s
Zone 5 = 4.2 – 5.3 m/s
Zone 6 = 5.3 – 6.7 m/s
Zone 7 = 6.7 – 8.1 m/s
Zone 8 = 8.1 – 11.0+ m/s

Hard running efforts: breaking 5.4 m/s for longer than a second
 Hard running meters: total distance that was over 5.4 m/s 
 
 
Work rate m: total distance meters/yards covered relative to time 
 
Top speed m: the fastest speed the player hit during the tracker time
